# Hello, World!

*February 23, 2020*

New Year's resolutions are decidedly out of fashion. In spite of that, on a cold January day I promised myself that this would be the year I started writing. I suppose the necessary impetus has come from my experiences in grad school. 

The aspiring researcher has two fundamental objectives. First, one must learn how to find and explore new ideas. Second, one must learn to present his new-found knowledge in such a way that it can be consumed in less time than it took to create it. Until one has mastered both these skills, one cannot fulfill the basic function of a scientist or thinker. 

Of course, 'thinker' is an obvious misnomer. Everyone thinks, and most people consider their thoughts rather good. To be a 'thinker' one must give form to thought, and thrust that form out into the world. And so here we are. Happy reading, friends.
